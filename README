One of the first projects I ever completed as a computer science student. 

The initial import will contain the original code as it was completed and submitted
for my class. I will be doing a lot of refactoring as I find some free time to work
on this. 

mastermind.py contains a working commandline implementation of the game. The other files are for a webapp that uses Google's AppEngine.
